The individual in question comes from a wealthy background, which seems to grant him immunity from facing murder charges. I'm truly stunned by the lack of murder charges against him. Both the judge overseeing this case and the lawyer defending the accused, who has taken the lives of two individuals, appear deeply rotten and they lack a moral compass. What steps can we take to rectify this injustice and reclaim this case?   \nIt's unacceptable that wealth can serve as a ticket to evade the consequences of murder.",

She asked me not to be so naive as to trust social media and that there are always two sides to every story.\n\nI didn't feel like discussing anything further, it was just tiring.\n\nToday, since the afternoon, she has been constantly labeling me as anti-women, anti-feminist, and a patriarchal chauvinist. She said even her mom is not happy with me on this.\n\nI can't understand her aggression.\n\nI was really happy and excited since we got engaged in November. I even agreed for simple wedding that she wants and make all arrangement on my own so that there is no load on her father.\n\nI am an introvert who mostly keeps to myself and is not very good with words, but I don't remember anyone belittling me like this in my life.\n\n..................................\n\n**Update \\[13.12.2024\\]:** Thank you for all, many of you have even reached out in DMs out of concern though I could not keep up with replies. Here's the update - my parents know about it, so does her dad who said that I understood her wrong. She is their only child and they are very proud of her. We two are not communicating and my excitement and attraction have evaporated. However marriage is not yet officially off. It's kind of 'under deliberation'. Turns out cancelling marriage is a big social stigma is our society for everyone. The best I can say today that it's a bit complicated. Personally I feel somewhat stupid, I used to think of myself as progressive and was proud to take on the all responsibilities and expense of wedding arrangements.\n\n**Update \\[16.12.2024\\]:** So it was a bad Sunday but I was not in the state to write here yesterday. My dad conveyed our displeasure to her dad and in response he came to our house yesterday with his nephew. Initially he said that I'm making an issue out of nothing, and later mistook it as an attempt from us to ask for dowry. So he asked us what all we want (\"you guys must have dreams and aspirations for your boy's marriage, tell me what all you need\"). Before the engagement, we clearly told them that we don't need anything and repeated the same. After some more discussion he lost temper and shouted at my mom. At this point, we kind of went silent. His nephew was interrupting all throughout and pointed out that the girl is from a far better college than me, which is true but they knew it from the beginning. Before leaving he told me he will return my hotel expense (when they came to meet us for the first time before finalizing the relation, I booked the hotel for their stay).\n\nI am feeling a mix of sadness, anger, and kind of defeated.\n\nSome of the new comments here calling me misogynistic, which I don't agree with but in retrospect I could've stayed away from retweeting stuff. My emotions were running high after watching Atul's video. I've deactivated my twitter and it says it will be completely deleted after 30 days.\n\nSigning off.",
